# Code.json Auto Generator

A GitHub Action that automatically generates and maintains code.json files for federal open source repositories, ensuring schema consistency and automating metadata calculations.

## About the Project

This project provides a GitHub Action that helps federal agencies maintain their code.json files, which are required for compliance with the Federal Source Code Policy. The action automatically calculates and updates various metadata fields including labor hours, programming languages used, repository information, and timestamps. It can either create pull requests or push directly to branches (with appropriate permissions), making it easier to keep code.json files accurate and up-to-date.

## Inputs

```yaml
GITHUB_TOKEN:
  description: "GitHub token used for API access and PR creation"
  required: true
  default: ${{ github.token }}

BRANCH:
  description: "Name of the branch to update"
  required: false

SKIP_PR:
  description: "Try to push directly to branch first, fallback to PR if it fails. Requires ADMIN_TOKEN."
  required: false
  default: "false"

ADMIN_TOKEN:
  description: "Personal Access Token with admin/write privileges for direct push. Required when SKIP_PR is true."
  required: false
```

## Outputs

```yaml
updated:
  description: "Boolean indicating whether code.json was updated"

pr_url:
  description: "URL of the created pull request if changes were made via PR"

commit_sha:
  description: "SHA of the commit if pushed directly to branch"

method_used:
  description: "Method used for the update: 'direct_push' or 'pull_request'"
```

## Workflow Examples

### Option 1: Direct Push

This approach tries to push directly to the branch using a Personal Access Token, but falls back to creating a pull request if the direct push fails. When users need to edit code.json, they should create a PR which will automatically validate their changes. Refer to this [section](https://github.com/DSACMS/automated-codejson-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-personal-access-token-pat) for a guide to create the necessary Personal Access Token.

```yaml
name: Update Code.json
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 1 * * # First day of every month
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    paths:
      - "code.json"

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  update-code-json:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Update code.json
        id: update
        uses: DSACMS/automated-codejson-generator@v1.2.0
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ADMIN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ADMIN_PAT }} # PAT with admin/push permissions
          BRANCH: "main"
          SKIP_PR: "true"

      - name: Report update method
        run: |
          echo "Update successful: ${{ steps.update.outputs.updated }}"
          if [ "${{ steps.update.outputs.method_used }}" = "direct_push" ]; then
            echo "Direct push successful! Commit SHA: ${{ steps.update.outputs.commit_sha }}"
          elif [ "${{ steps.update.outputs.method_used }}" = "pull_request" ]; then
            echo "Created pull request: ${{ steps.update.outputs.pr_url }}"
          fi
```

### Option 2: Pull Request Only

This approach always creates a pull request for both automatic generation and validation of manual edits, ensuring code review for all changes.

```yaml
name: Update Code.json
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 1 * * # First day of every month
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    paths:
      - "code.json"

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  update-code-json:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Update code.json
        uses: DSACMS/automated-codejson-generator@v1.2.0
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: "main"
          SKIP_PR: "false"
```

### How It Works

**Automatic Generation**

- The action calculates metadata, validates it, and creates a PR or pushes directly
- Validation ensures only valid code.json is created
- Users can then fill in manual fields by editing the PR

**PR Validation**

- When users edit code.json in a PR, validation runs automatically on every commit
- The PR cannot be merged if validation fails (when branch protection is enabled)
- Error messages help users fix issues quickly

**Important:** For direct push mode, users should always create PRs when manually editing code.json to ensure validation runs. Direct edits to the main branch will not be validated by this action.

## Setting Up Personal Access Token (PAT)

To use the direct push functionality, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token:

### Creating a PAT

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**: Navigate to your GitHub account settings
2. **Developer Settings**: Click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar
3. **Personal Access Tokens**: Choose "Tokens (classic)"
4. **Generate New Token**: Click "Generate new token"
5. **Configure Token**:
   - **Name**: Give it a name like "code.json Generator"
   - **Expiration**: Set appropriate expiration (recommend 90 days or 1 year)
   - **Scopes**:
     - Select `repo` (full repository access)
6. **Store Token**: Copy and paste your token and store it for the next part

### Adding PAT to Repository

1. **Repository Settings**: Go to your repository's Settings tab
2. **Secrets and Variables**: Click on "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. **New Secret**: Click "New repository secret"
4. **Configure Secret**:
   - **Name**: `ADMIN_PAT`
   - **Value**: Paste your Personal Access Token
5. **Save**: Click "Add secret"

## Generation Context

The automated code.json generator calculates specific fields by analyzing your repository and using GitHub's API. Here's what gets generated and what your repository needs for successful generation.

**name**: This field pulls directly from your repository's name as configured in GitHub. No configuration needed.

**description**: The generator extracts this from your repository's description field in GitHub settings. _Make sure you've added a description to your repository through GitHub's interface for this field to populate properly._

**repositoryURL**: This automatically uses your repository's public GitHub URL. No configuration needed.

**repositoryVisibility**: The generator determines whether your repository is private or public. No configuration needed.

**laborHours**: The generator runs SCC against your workspace to analyze your codebase and estimate development time. No configuration needed.

**languages**: This field populates the programming languages in your repository. No configuration needed.

**SBOM**: The repository's SBOM URL in the format of {repositoryURL/network/dependencies}. If you already have a code.json file with the SBOM, the generator preserves those values. No configuration needed.

**dateCreated**: The generator pulls your repository's creation date. No configuration needed.

**dateLastModified**: This uses your repository's last update timestamp, reflecting the most recent changes. No configuration needed.

**dateMetadataLastUpdated**: The generator sets this to the current timestamp each time it runs, providing a record of when the metadata was last refreshed. No configuration needed.

**feedbackMechanism**: The repository's issues URL in the format of {repositoryURL}/issues. If you already have a code.json file with existing feedback mechanisms, the generator preserves those values. No configuration needed.
