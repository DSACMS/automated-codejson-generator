# Contributing Guidelines

We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

## Getting Started

Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` for good opportunities to contribute. These issues are specifically chosen to help newcomers get involved with the project.

### Team Specific Guidelines

Our project maintainers are listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). They are responsible for reviewing and merging all pull requests. Feel free to tag them in issues or pull requests for assistance.

### Building Dependencies

To work on this project, you'll need:

1. Node.js 20 or later
2. Go 1.22 or later
3. SCC tool (installed via `go install github.com/boyter/scc/v3@latest`)
4. GitHub CLI (optional, but helpful for testing)

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DSACMS/code-json-generator.git
cd code-json-generator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run package

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Validation

The action uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for schema validation, automatically validating code.json in two scenarios:

### 1. Before Generation

Every time the action generates or updates code.json (via schedule or workflow_dispatch), it validates the output before creating a PR or pushing. If validation fails, no changes are made.

### 2. On PR Edits

When the `pull_request` trigger is configured, the action validates code.json whenever it's edited in a PR. This ensures users cannot accidentally merge invalid JSON.

### Workflow and Branching

We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):

1. Fork the project
2. Check out the `main` branch
3. Create a feature branch
4. Write code and tests for your change
5. From your branch, make a pull request against `DSACMS/code-json-generator/main`
6. Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7. Wait for your change to be pulled into `DSACMS/code-json-generator/main`
8. Delete your feature branch

### Testing Conventions

- Tests are written using Jest and can be found in the `__tests__` directory
- Run tests with `npm test`
- All new features should include corresponding test coverage
- Test files should follow the naming convention: `*.test.ts`

### Coding Style and Linters

1. This project uses TypeScript and follows standard TypeScript conventions
2. We follow the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatting rules
3. ESLint is used for code linting
4. All code must pass typechecking and linting before being merged
5. Run `npm run lint` to check your code

### Writing Issues

```markdown
### Description
